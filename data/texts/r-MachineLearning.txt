TITLE: Is transfer learning and fine-tuning still necessary with modern zero-shot models?
CONTENT: Hello. I am a machine learning student, I have been doing this for a while, and I found a concept called "transfer learning" and topics like "fine tuning". In short, my dream is to be an ML or AI engineer. Lately I hear that all the models that are arriving, such as Sam Anything (Meta), Whisper (Open AI), etc., are zero-shot models that do not require tuning no matter how specific the problem is. The truth is, I ask this because right now at university we are studying PyTorch and transfer learning. and If in reality it is no longer necessary to tune models because they are zero-shot, then it does not make sense to learn architectures and know which optimizer or activation function to choose to find an accurate model. Could you please advise me and tell me what companies are actually doing? To be honest, I feel bad. I put a lot of effort into learning optimization techniques, evaluation, and model training with PyTorch.
